# new programming language that I need a name for
Programming language that you type sentences ?

### To Do
- Come up with a name
- Finalize the syntax
- Figure out what programming language to write the compiler/interpreter in
- Figure out if the lang is compiled or interpreted or both
- Low or high level

### Whats so nice about this?
I dont know yet but here is what I can try to follow
- Words and commas ? 
- Readable code. Almost like it isnt even code..
- Types or no types? idk
- Everything is confusing right now: yes
- You want to help? Hopefully you have knowledge on making programming langs. Ill give you a secret _join my dev discord server_ <- Im useless and didnt put a link so you can find it on my profile (btw Im insberr) 

## Idea
The idea is that it's all typed out like you are talking, or, more like writing.  
Truly going to be hard to make a language like this, but it's worth a try.


I want to avoid the use of : ; ( ) { } as much as possible

Only an idea but here is an example:

```wl
declare x and set it to 1
if x is 0, then
  print "Hello World"
otherwise,
  set x to 0
```

The above example is only an idea. Of course no one wants to write a long statement to set a variable named x to 1, but the idea is there.

Here are a few other ideas:

```wl
// Idea 1

make x, set to 1

if x is 0,
  print "Hello World"
otherwise
  set x to 0


// Idea 2

// Declaring a new variable and setting it to 
make x be 1

if x is 0 then,
  print "Hello World"
otherwise,
  set x to 0


// more ideas

make arr be ["red", "orange", "yellow"]

for every color in arr, print the color

// would print:
// red
// orange
// yellow




wait 10 seconds, then print "Waited 10 seconds"



// functions
// make for function declaration and name for variables?

make testFunction with (?a is 1, !b, ?c) that returns 1 value,
  print a b and c
  return add a, b, and ?c

name a and run testFunction where,
  b is 2
  c is 1

print a

// 4



// variable that's value can be changed
name meaning_of_life be 1

// variable that's value can't be changed
name meaning_of_life is 1


// changing the value of a variable
name meaning_of_life be 1
set meaning_of_life to 42

```

Of course this is all just an idea. I don't even know how to make a programming language so this might stay an idea.



Idk why but the syntax highlighting looks nice. Idk what lang uses that syntax highlighting but ok.
